      <p class="title text-primary">Welcome to Kosmos Market!</p>
      <p class="description">We'll like to take a moment to share with you what Kosmos Market is all about and how you can make the most out of your time here. First of all, Kosmos Market has nothing to do with any other market that uses or has used the brand to promote itself. We built this site becuase have profound respect for freedom and anonimity.</p>
      <p class="description">You may be shocked to find listings here that are outlawed in your jurisdiction or defy moral ethics. That doesn't mean Kosmos Market is lawless. In fact, we have a very strict code of conduct that, if given a chance, most people we think would agree with. Our basic rules are to treat others as you would wish to be treated, mind your own business, and don't do anything to hurt or scam someone else. In the spirit of those rules, there are some things you will never see here, and if you do please report them. They include child pornography and execution videos, just to name a few. We also hold our members to the highest standards of personal conduct and work tirelessly to prevent, root out and stop any scammers that may try to prey upon others.</p>
      <p class="description">However, the best way to stay safe and make sure your experience here is enjoyable, is to educate yourself on how Kosmos Market works, and take advantage of all the tools and guidelines we have put out for you. A link to a complete guide can be found on your account page, but here are a few tips to get you started:</p>

         <li>
            <strong>Always use the escrow system!</strong> This can't be stressed enough. 99% of scams are from people who set up fake vendor accounts and ask buyers to pay them directly or release payment before their order arrives. This behavior should be reported immediately. If you do choose to do this, we will be completely unable to help you in the event of fraud.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Check the wiki always for updates.</strong> It contains a wealth of information and all of our moderators are eager to help a new member with a respectful attitude.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Start small.</b> Do a few small trades until you are comfortable with the process before throwing all of your Moneros at a big purchase.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="description">The old saying: "With freedom comes responsibility‚Äù, couldn't be more true here. You will find easy access to things that could get you in trouble with your authorities and are downright terrible for your health. So, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. However, we're not your parents and it's your responsiblity to judge what is good and bad for you. No one else can do that.</p>
      <p class="description">Stay safe and have fun!</p>
